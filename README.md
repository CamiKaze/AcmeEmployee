# AcmeEmployee
# Send birthday and anniversary wishes to employees.

In this application, I demonstrate how to consume and extract information from an API (https://eohmc-acme-api.azurewebsites.net/api/Employees).

The information (birthday and work anniversary) is used as part of an emailer where we can send an email to an employee on his/her birthday or anniversary.

It is noted that that data extracted from the endpoint contain JSON, there are no birthdays or work anniversaries related to the current date or any date in this year (2020).

I have used functional programming and SOLID principles to develop said application.
